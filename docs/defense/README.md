# PhD Defense Slides

This directory contains the slides used during my PhD defense, in which AUDiaL was presented, on the 18<sup>th</sup> of February, 2022.

#### A note on PDF Viewers

The PDF slides contain JavaScript driven animations created with the [`animate`](https://ctan.org/pkg/animate?lang=en) LaTeX package. Unfortunately, not many PDF viewers currently support this kind of embedded graphics. 

At the moment of writing, these slides are best viewed using [Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/).
