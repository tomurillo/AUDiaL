# AUDiaL Evaluation

This directory contains [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) describing the evaluation methodology of AUDiaL and some of its conclusions. In order to run the notebooks yourself you will need a local Python 3 environment with  `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `scipy` packages installed. A scientific Python distribution such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is thus recommended.

Alternatively, you may render these notebooks directly online. Because of a well-known [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3555#issuecomment-519343850) with Github's rendering queue of Jupyer notebooks, using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) is recommended instead. Simply follow these links to render the notebooks in your browser:

* [Demographic Report](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tomurillo/AUDiaL/blob/master/docs/evaluation/demographic_report.ipynb): demographic information about the participants that took part in the study.
* [Evaluation Report](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tomurillo/AUDiaL/blob/master/docs/evaluation/evaluation_report.ipynb): this notebook outlines the evaluation methodology as well as the main conclusions derived from it.

Raw data is also available: [demographic](data/AUDiaL_demographic_anonymized.csv) / [evaluation](data/AUDiaL_evaluation_anonymized.csv).

The data and notebooks will be regularly updated when new evaluation sessions take place.
